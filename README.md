Filling this out with a lil about me. 

I'm a college student who enjoys making digital art in her free time. 
I have two dogs at home, both labradors. The oldest on is a chocolate lab nammed Senna, and the youngest is a black lab named Tazi.

I could yap more but i also enjoy remaining slightly mysterious and also talking about myself is hard.
